# Matrix Processor

## Project Description
It's a console application developed by Emiliano Pisano, whose main goal is to loop through a square matrix of values separated by "," and find the longest chain of equeal adjacent characters.

The matrix to use can be provided by entering the file path when the program requests it, or by pressing the ENTER key. By doing this, the progam will use the test matrix that it has stored internally.
After that, the program will take care of iterate on the matrix in all possible directions to achieve its objective. When finished, it will show which is the longest chain of adjacent equal characters, as well as the direction in which they are located, and the starting coordinates of it.

## Technologies Used in the Project
To develop this project, I used the following technologies:
- Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 (64 bits)
- C# as the chosen programming language

## How to Run the Project
The only you need to be able to use this console application is the Microsoft Visual Studio (I used the 2022 Enterprise edition).
If you have it, should download the project from the github repository, and open the solution. After that, you should just run the project and if all works fine, you will see a console window. Inside this, you should enter the path of your matrix file, or click ENTER to use the default matrix (included in the project).
After that, the process will start to iterate on the matrix, to find the longest chain. When it is found, in the console window you could know that chain, and your direction and start's coordinates.
